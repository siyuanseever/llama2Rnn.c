# -Ofast enables all -O3 optimizations.
# Disregards strict standards compliance.
# It also enables optimizations that are not valid for all standard-compliant programs.
# It turns on -ffast-math, -fallow-store-data-races and the Fortran-specific
# -fstack-arrays, unless -fmax-stack-var-size is specified, and -fno-protect-parens.
# It turns off -fsemantic-interposition.
# In our specific application this is *probably* okay to use
